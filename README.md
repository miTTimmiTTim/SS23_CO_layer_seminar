# SS23_CO_layer_seminar
This project is a case study for the seminar paper "An introduction to probabilistic CO layer in
hybrid pipelines" implementing the methods from the Julia InferOpt.jl package.

 ## Content
 data_prep.ipynb creates the input data used for the pipelines.
 The pipelines are built based on the different layers from InferOpt.jl 
 and evaluated using a TSP with pick-up and delivery. analysis.ipynb consolidates the results and creates graphs for the seminar Paper.
